              Following the sound of water, the trees around you slowly start to
              dissipate, until you reach a clearing in the forest. The sun
              shines brightly here, bathing the open area in a warm light. Birds
              can be heard singing and moving in the trees around you. In front
              of you is a cheerful bubbling <span class="orange">Stream</span>.
              Out of the corner of your eye you notice something shining on a
              nearby <span class="orange">Tree</span>. You can exit the clearing
              to the <span class="green">East</span>.
            </p>

            <!-- hidden "Look Stream"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Look">
              The stream before you is crystal clear, allowing you to gaze down
              to the rocky bottom below. Brightly coloured fish dart around just
              below the surface, seemingly unaware of your presence. As you look
              upstream, you notice that there is a mountain range not too far in
              the distance and the stream appears to have run down from there.
              This water is definitely drinkable.
            </p>

            <!-- hidden "Look Tree"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Look">
              You glance up at the tree to get a better look at the shimmering
              that caught your attention. Stuck in one of the branches is a
              <span class="yellow">Key</span> dangling from a frayed piece of
              leather. It looks like it has been there a while.
            </p>

            <!-- hidden "Get Key"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Get">
              You reach up, stretching your arm as far as it will reach, but
              cannot quite grab the key. You resign yourself to having to
              gracelessly shimmy up the tree trunk, scuffing your clothes in the
              process but at least you aren't coming down empty handed. You
              pocket the key and tap your trousers for good measure.
            </p>
            <!-- for the "Use Stream" command (without bucket in inv): -->
            <p class="textp hidden Use">
              With no containers to collect water in, you stoop down and scoop
              up a few handfuls of water, drinking deeply. The water is cool and
              refreshing.
