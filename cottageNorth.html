              You follow the dirt path, which eventually leads you to a badly
              broken picket fence. Stepping over the remains you see a cottage
              up ahead. Upon approaching the building, you notice that there is
              a makeshift barricade in front of the door. All of the windows are
              boarded up but there is one
              <span class="orange">Window</span> that is partially uncovered.
              You can exit to the <span class="green">South</span>.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Look Window"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Look">
              You decide to step up to the window to see if you can get an idea
              of what is inside. A thick layer of dirt and dust covers the
              glass, which you gingerly wipe away with one hand. Cupping your
              hands round your eyes to get a better view, you lean in close to
              the glass. It all appears dark, dead and still. Something darts
              suddenly into your field of vision, a furry blur with no
              distinguishable features. It shoots by the window and out of view.
              Did it notice you? A low growl emanates from within the building.
              It seems unwise to try to break in unless you are armed with
              something to protect yourself from whatever is inside.
