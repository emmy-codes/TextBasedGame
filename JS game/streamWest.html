        <p class="textp">Following the sound of water, the trees around you slowly start to dissipate, until you reach a clearing in the forest. 
                        The sun shines brightly here, bathing the open area in a warm light. Birds can be heard singing and moving in the trees around you. 
                        In front of you is a cheerful bubbling <span class="orange">Stream</span>. 
                        Out of the corner of your eye you notice something shining on a nearby <span class="orange">Tree</span>. 
                        You can exit the clearing to the <span class="green">East</span>.
        </p>

        <!-- hidden "Look Stream"-->
    <p class="textp hidden Look"> The stream before you is crystal clear, allowing you to gaze down to the rocky bottom below. Brightly coloured fish dart around just below the surface,
         seemingly unaware of your presence. As you look upstream, you notice that there is a mountain range not too far in the distance and the stream appears to have run down from there. 
         This water is definitely drinkable. </p>

        <!-- hidden "Look Tree"-->
    <p class="textp hidden Look"> You glance up at the tree to get a better look at the shimmering that caught your attention. 
        Stuck in one of the branches is a <span class="yellow">Key</span> dangling from a frayed piece of leather. It looks like it has been there a while. </p>

        <!-- hidden "Get Key"-->
    <p class="textp hidden Get">You reach up, stretching your arm as far as it will reach, but cannot quite grab the key. You resign yourself to having to gracelessly shimmy up the tree trunk,
       scuffing your clothes in the process but at least you aren't coming down empty handed. You pocket the key and tap your trousers for good measure.</p>
            <!-- for the "Use Stream" command (without bucket in inv): -->
      <p class="textp hidden Use">With no containers to collect water in, you stoop down and scoop up a few handfuls of water, drinking deeply.
        The water is cool and refreshing.</p>
