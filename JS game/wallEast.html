        <p class="textp">Struggling through the dense undergrowth, you eventually reach a patch of grass that is almost possible to stand on without being scratched by foliage. 
                         In front of you is a <span class="orange">Moss</span> covered wall, the stones rounded from years of weathering and lack of upkeep. 
                         There is a wooden <span class="orange">Ladder</span> leaning precariously against the wall. 
                        You can exit to the <span class="green">West</span>.
        </p>

        <!--hidden "Look Moss"-->  
        <p class="textp hidden Look">At first glance it just looks as though the wall is entirely covered in moss, but as you tilt your head and gaze more intently at it, 
          you notice that the moss is darker in places that looks roughly like an archway. Brushing away a few chunks reveals some sort of door, clearly long forgotten. 
          A quick tug at the handle tells you that it is locked, and you would need a key to open it.</p>
        <!--hidden "Look Ladder"-->
        <p class="textp hidden Look">Upon closer inspection, you can see that the ladder has seen better days. The wood appears to be slightly rotted, and one of the lower rungs is missing.</p>
        <!--hidden "Use Ladder"-->
        <p class="textp hidden Use">Deciding it is worth the risk, you grab hold of the ladder with both hands. It creaks beneath your grip, but you put one foot on the first rung, 
          then the other foot on the next. As your foot lands on the third rung you hear a loud snapping sound as the frail wood beneath your foot gives way and sends you tumbling back 
          down to the ground. Best not to try that again.</p>
