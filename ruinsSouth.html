              Taking the cobbled path leads you to what looks like an open field
              at first glance, but then you realise the stumps on the ground
              where the wooden posts would have been. Beyond this lays the
              charred remains of what must have been a barn, judging by the
              nearby husk of a burnt out tractor. Upon closer inspection you
              spot a jar of <span class="orange">Peaches</span>, a
              <span class="orange">Bucket</span>, and a
              <span class="orange">Shovel</span>. You can exit to the
              <span class="green">North</span>.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Look Peaches"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Look">
              You kneel down and turn the tin around to check the label. It has
              a good date on it and can easily be saved for later. Lucky for you
              it has a ring pull lid so you won't need anything special to open
              it with.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Look Bucket"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Look">
              You stoop down to take a look at the bucket. It appears in
              relatively good shape, has few dents in it and no rusting. To your
              dismay there is a hole close to the bottom; it looks as though
              someone intentionally sabotaged it to be unusable.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Look Shovel"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Look">
              You glance down at the shovel. It has been struck into the soil,
              presumably to keep it standing once someone was finished with it.
              It looks like they never came back to finish the job. The handle
              seems well used, but otherwise whole.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Get Peaches"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Get">
              You scoop up the tin of peaches and tuck it away in your backpack,
              feeling rather pleased with yourself.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Get Bucket"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Get">
              Shrugging, you decide that the bucket is worth taking despite the
              damage. Perhaps it can be fixed or otherwise be made useful later
              on.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Get Shovel"-->
            <p class="textp hidden Get">
              You casually hoist the shovel over your shoulder and into your
              backpack. You never know when it might come in handy.
            </p>
            <!--hidden "Use Peaches *needs an alert and a yes/no, along with a confirmation command after eating or returning:
          Are you sure you want to eat this? Maybe someone else needs it more than you, then again it is better not to go hungry too"-->
