              You are stood in a gloomy area of a forest. It is a sunny day, but
              the thick canopy above means the light can only trickle through in
              patches that appear to dance across the floor. The air feels
              thick, moist, and slightly unnerving. No birds are singing. It
              looks like you are alone, although you sense you are being
              watched. You can see a
              <span class="orange">Treestump</span> nearby with something
              leaning against it. There is a dirt path leading
              <span class="green">North</span>, a very overgrown path to the
              <span class="green">East</span>, a neat but old cobbled road
              leading <span class="green">South</span>, and the sound of running
              water coming from the <span class="green">West</span>.
            </p>

            <p class="textp hidden Look">
              You gingerly approach the treestump before realising that the
              object you had spotted was just an
              <span class="yellow">Axe</span> that had fallen on its' side.
              Perhaps this could be useful?
            </p>

            <p class="textp hidden Get">
              You bend down to retrieve the axe, casually noting that the blade
              is as sharp as the day it was made, despite being covered in dirt.
              Brushing the worst of the muck away you carefully place it in your
              backpack, then look around to see what to do next.
