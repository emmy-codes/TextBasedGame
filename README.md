# TextBasedGame

This was my first exposure to JavaScript and I instantly went for the option to make a text based game when our Industry Leader offered it.

This game was heavily based off games I played as a child, one was on a floppy disk and I remember the name as The Secret Garden, but googling nowadays I can't seem to find anything to match it. It was also inspired by Realms of Kaos, a MUD I played as a teenager in around 2000-2002.

We had three weeks to complete this project which wasn't much when you hsd to learn, understand, practice and succeed with brand new concepts, so I received a lot of help with what I needed to use and how to use it. This was a brand new language for me. 

I wanted to create a game that receieved your text input, which turned out to be a large challenge. I hadn't learned about arrays and found the concept confusing, but I focused on the fact that this would enable my text box to look for the exact words I wanted the user to input, and to react differently depending on the word.

The best way I knew at the time to send the user to another page was by making a new html page for it, so each of my "Go" commands needed to link to snother page also.

I started learning about arrays and methods
